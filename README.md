	# {ScaleForce}

## How to Deploy

Our frontend consists of 3 React based applications that interact with both our Auth and API servers.

Our 3 apps are for:

- back office (adminstration)
- cashier (front desk, check in, managing appointments)
- online-store (customer page for booking a haircut and viewing their appointments)

Our applications are all being hosted on Netlify using their free usuage. They are then sent out to CDNs all over the US for better speeds. This plan can easily be upgraded to support more users.
