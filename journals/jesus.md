### Tasks

### Accomplishments

I primarily worked on [CRA for 3 Apps](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-scaleforce/projects/1#card-59304337)
The purpose of this task was to create 3 React Apps for each front end. 

- Cashier 
- Online-Store
- BackOffice

Cashier was pair programmed with John.

### Challenges

When testing the React Apps with Tailwindcss I found out that issues occurred when using Node.js version 10 or lower.
Therefore, updated package.json to assure that only Node.js versions 11+ are used.
