# Jesus's Journal

## Week 1: 4/15 - 4/22

### Tasks

### Accomplishments

I primarily worked on [CRA for 3 Apps](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-scaleforce/projects/1#card-59304337)
The purpose of this task was to create 3 React Apps for each front end. 

- Cashier 
- Online-Store
- BackOffice

Cashier was pair programmed with John.

### Challenges

When testing the React Apps with Tailwindcss I found out that issues occurred when using Node.js version 10 or lower.
Therefore, updated package.json to assure that only Node.js versions 11+ are used.

## Week 2: 4/22 - 4/29

### Tasks

### Accomplishments

I finished the remaining front-end changes for cashier and online-store based on @John contributions to backoffice.
[Login Pages for Apps](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-scaleforce/projects/1#card-59304339)

- Login page
- Signup Page
- Navbar
- CSS Changes 

Also reasearched ways to share reusable components between the 3 React Apps to reduce redudancy.  
[Bit](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/tutorials/bit-react-tutorial) and [Bit.dev](https://bit.dev/) seem to be the solution but require more research.

### Challenges

Compile issues occurred when imported components. Was able to fix them by installing the appropriate React packages

## Week 3: 4/29 - 5/6

### Tasks

### Accomplishments

Started working on connection between React Apps and API.
[Create a new User and Hash Passwords](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-scaleforce/projects/1#card-60550765)

- installed axios
- installed bcrypt
- started testing connection to API

### Challenges

First time use of axios has delayed my progress to get a working connection. Will continue to work on this task into week 4

Connecting to the API was more difficult expected, therefore asked John for review. John discovered connection issues occurred due to a CORS error.
