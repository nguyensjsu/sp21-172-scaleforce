## Week 1: 4/15 - 4/22

### Tasks

For this sprint I worked on this issue: [Creating Auth Server](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-scaleforce/issues/5)

I also created a base project but that was mainly to test the github workflow: [create base folders](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-scaleforce/issues/1)

I also added some comments to John's google doc on the data structures and tables for the application

### Accomplishments
Currently the auth server has all the main functionality needed. It needs another PR to open up admin access via the stubbede interceptor pattern to allow CRUD operations

### Challenges
The main challenge I faced was getting the libraries (namely the Java JWT library) to function correctly. The core problem was in my build.gradle, and resolving it was a combination of using the readme and googling error messages. 
I also had a bit of trouble correctly externalizing the config, but after looking around at how to create a context that uses the application.yml, I got it working with that and a properties file. I saw how you could use a bean that leaves a placeholder configuration and then you can inject it into the application.
