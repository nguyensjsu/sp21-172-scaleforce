### Tasks

### Accomplishments

I primarily worked on [Create
protoype](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-scaleforce/issues/3). The
purpose of this task was to prototype:

- a REST API via Spring Boot,
- a React app to consume the REST API,
- local deployment scripts / documentation, and
- GKE deployment scripts / documentation

Asides from that, I reviewed the frontend team's work re: [CRA for 3
Apps](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-scaleforce/issues/4).

### Challenges
